# Terminal Command Rules

## NEVER Do These

1. **NEVER run a command in the background and then separately tail/monitor it**
   - BAD: `./script.sh &` then `tail -f output.txt`
   - BAD: `./script.sh 2>&1 | tee file.txt &` then `tail file.txt`
   - GOOD: Just run the command directly and wait for it to complete

2. **NEVER use `tail -f`, `--follow`, or any streaming/watching commands** unless explicitly asked
   - BAD: `kubectl logs --follow`
   - BAD: `tail -f /var/log/something`
   - GOOD: `kubectl logs --tail=50`
   - GOOD: `tail -100 file.txt`

3. **NEVER poll/check output repeatedly** while a command is running
   - If a command times out, that is fine - check the terminal file for results
   - Do not run the same command multiple times to check progress

## Long-Running Commands

For commands that take a long time (like test suites):
1. Run the command directly with is_background: false
2. If it times out, read the terminal file to see results
3. Do NOT start it in background and then poll for results

## Test Execution

Always use the project test script:
NAMESPACE=cost-onprem ./scripts/run-pytest.sh --no-ui

Never run pytest directly or tail test output separately.
